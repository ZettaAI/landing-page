                <p style="text-align: left">We reconstruct neuronal wiring diagrams by processing electron microscopic images that are sharp enough to reveal every brain cell in fantastic detail, including synapses and other organelles.
                    Our computational pipeline applies multiple 3D convolutional nets to datasets as large as a petavoxel.<br><br>

                    We continue our trailblazing in the ten-year project to map a whole mouse brain at synaptic resolution.
                    This transformative project will make exascale connectomics a reality.<br><br>

                    A human brain would yield a zettabyte of data, if imaged at electron microscopic resolution.<br>
                That means 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 bytes.</p>
